# Library_Management_System
:- This is a simple implementation of a Library Management System (LMS) using C++. The program allows users to manage a collection of books by performing various operations such as entering book data, editing book information, deleting books, searching for books, and displaying the book collection.

# Features

* Edit existing book information, including author name, title, publication, and book ID.
* Delete books from the collection either by book ID or book title.
* Search for books in the collection based on book ID or book title.
* Display the entire book collection.

# How to Use

* Choose an option from the menu to perform the corresponding operation.
* To enter book data, select option 1 and provide the required information.
* To edit book information, select option 2, and follow the instructions to choose a book for editing and update its details.
* To delete books, select option 3, and follow the instructions to delete specific books or clear the entire collection.

# File Persistence
:- The program uses file I/O to store the book records in the file named "LMS.txt". The data is saved to the file whenever a new book is added, book information is edited, or a book is deleted. On program startup, it loads the data from the file into the linked list.
